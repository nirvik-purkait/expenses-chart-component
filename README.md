The goal is to creat a website that is as similar as it can be, related to the original provided template.


# 🗒️About the project

When you are seeing the project it may have not completed yet, and the 
progress is still on. But for sure, if I do any kind of changes to make
it more accurate I would update here too. 

The project is best viewed at 
- 375px width and 812px height for mobile view

# 🚀 About Me

I'm at the learning stage of the field Web Development . Started learning few months ago, and now I belive that I'm quite good and confident to start building some template projects and show-off some of my skills.

Basically whatever I have learned most of them are self-tought, the result of facing problem in real time while doing some project.
